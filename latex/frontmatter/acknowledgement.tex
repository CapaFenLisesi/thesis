I spent four perfect years as a member of the Computational and Biological Learning lab in Cambridge. I want to use this space to thank everybody who contributed to my feeling this way.

CBL is the best place to do a PhD in machine learning, academically and socially. It was M\'{a}t\'{e} Lengyel who got me started on Bayesian statistics and machine learning before I started my PhD, and having a mentor and friend like him around has been invaluable ever since. Zoubin and Carl are best in their field. Their excellent lectures at the Machine Learning Summer School in 2007 inspired me to apply for a PhD in Cambridge, and I have learnt so much from them since then.

I am lucky to have joined CBL early enough to know the very first batch of PhD students. This also meant I was the first generation to face the experience of people graduating and leaving. I will not attempt to name all the students and firends I worked with, because I am bound to leave people out. I wish the stimulating environment that CBL have built will last and inspire several future generations of students.

Completing my thesis research would not have been possible without my close collaborators and coauthors Neil, David, Miguel, Simon, Mohammad, Gerg\H{o}, Daniel, M\'{a}t\'{e} and Zoubin. Thanks for all the discussions that happened in the lab and outside. Thanks to Phil Dawid for useful discussions about scoring rules. Thanks to all the anonymous reviewers of numerous harsh conference reviews and rejection letters over the years; no offence taken. Thanks to people proofreading my work.

 I am grateful for Trinity College for funding my studies, and I am proud to have been a member of this great institution. 

Finally, I want to thank PeerIndex for their support and patience in the final year.
