# List of corrections and changes made

## General
 - fixed punctuation of equations
 - corrected typos and wording

## Abstract and Introducuction
 - removed unnecessary references to information geometry


## Chapter 1
 - New Section 1.3.3 on Composite likelihoods, with connection to pseudo-likelihood and mention of sandwich operator
 - mentioned Integral Squared Error (ISE) in section 1.3.4 (Brier score) section 1.3.6 (kernel score, MMD)
 - added discussion of fundamental likelihood - Fisher info - KL - Cremer Rao connection
 - improved Summary section with references to future research directions, and hints at how this is going to be used in the rest of the thesis

## Appendix A - what used to be Chapter 2
 - moved to the end, only referenced from summary of Chapter 1

## Chapter 2 - Approximate inference intro
 - more detailed Summary of Contributions section acknowledging work done by others and myself
 - second paragraph now discusses model evidence vs. full Bayesian approach [as per Mark's remark]
 - added remark on EP convergence with references

## Chapter 3 - herding vs Bayesian quadrature
 - more explicit Summary of Contributions section precisely detailing original contributions
 - improved introduction emphasizing the main contributions of the chapter
 - added reference to Girolami & He in section 3.3.1 (with discussion of sparse weights) and in 3.7 Summary and Conclusions

## Chapter 4 - Bayesian active learning intro
 - more explicit Summary of Contributions section
 - extended discussion of existing research on Bayesian experiment design and their limitations

## Chapter 5 - BALD
 - did not include error bars (would have made figures very crowded) but discussed that most differences are not significant
 - changed the exposition of results to be more honest
 - discussed that classification/preference learning are not very challenging problems

## Chapter 6 - Quantum Tomography
