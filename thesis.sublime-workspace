The posterior distribution $p_\\data = p(\\param\\vert\\data)$ captures all statistically relevant information that the data $\\data$ provides about $\\param$, and it is therefore of central importance.\n   23  \n   24: The marginal likelihood, also called the model evidence $Z = \\int p(\\data\\vert\\param) p(\\param) d\\param$ is also of interest. It is often used to quantify how well a Bayesian model -- the combination of likelihood and prior -- fit the data. When the model involves additinal parameters or hyper-parameters that are not modelled probabilistically via prior distributions, it is common practice to learn their values by maximising model evidence \\citep[see \\eg][Chapter 5]{Rasmussen2006}.\n   25  \n   26  In practically interesting Bayesian models, the posterior distribution and model evidence are often computationally intractable to obtain and therefore one has to resort to approximations. The most popular methods for Bayesian approximate inference are variational inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo.\n\n/Users/fhuszar/Dropbox/thesis/latex/part2/02_herding.tex:\n  362  This means that the estimate converges for any bounded measurable function $f$. The speed of convergence, however, may not be as fast.\n  363  \n  364: Therefore it is crucial that the kernel we choose is representative of the function or functions $f$ we will integrate.  For example, in our experiments, the convergence of herding was sensitive to the width of the Gaussian kernel.  One of the major weaknesses of kernel methods in general is the difficulty of setting kernel parameters.  A key benefit of the Bayesian interpretation of herding and MMD presented in this paper is that it provides a recipe for adapting the Hilbert space to the observations $f(x_n)$.  To be precise, we can fit the kernel parameters by maximizing the marginal likelihood of Gaussian process conditioned on the observations.  Details can be found in \\citep{rasmussen38gaussian}.\n  365  \n  366  \\subsection{Computational Complexity}\n\n/Users/fhuszar/Dropbox/thesis/latex/part3/02_GP_BALD.tex:\n   81  BALD exploits the fact that in many active learning applications the output space $\\Ye$ is often simpler than the parameter space $\\Theta$. Here I consider the problem of active learning for binary classification, when the output takes one of two possible values $y \\in \\{-1,1\\}$. Given the simplicity of the outputs, binary classification is a highly relevant use-case for BALD.\n   82  \n   83: I will use a non-parametric Bayesian classification model, Gaussian process classification \\citep[GPC,][]{rasmussen06GP} to demonstrate the usefulness of BALD: GPC appears to be an especially challenging problem for information-theoretic active learning because its parameter space is infinite. Therefore, computing entropy of the posterior involves nontrivial quantities. However, by using the BALD approach and Eqn.\\ \\eqref{eqn:rearrangement} we are able to fully calculate the relevant information quantities without having to work out entropies of infinite dimensional objects. \n   84  \n   85  \n   ..\n   94  \\TODO{I need an appendix on kernels and Gaussian processes}\n   95  \n   96: We consider the probit case where, given the value of $f$, the binary label $y$ takes a Bernoulli distribution with probability $\\Phi(f(\\x))$, and $\\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution. For further details on GPC see \\citep{rasmussen2005}.\n   97  \n   98  Posterior inference in the GPC model is intractable; given some observations $\\data$, the posterior over $f$ becomes non-Gaussian and complicated. This is addressed by using approximate inference methods. The most commonly used approximate inference methods for Gaussian process classification are expectation propagation \\citep[EP,][]{Minka2002}, Laplace's approximation \\citep{williams1998}, assumed density filtering \\citep[ADF,][]{csato2000} and sparse methods \\citep{candela05sparseGP}. These all approximate the non-Gaussian posterior by a Gaussian \\citep{Nickisch2008}, but differ in the optimisation criterion and other restrictions. Throughout this chapter I will assume that we are provided with some Gaussian approximation to the GPC posterior resulting from one of these methods, though the active learning method is agnostic as to which method produced this estimate. Given the sequential nature of active learning, fast on-line methods \\citep{Csato2002} are particularly well suited for the task. In our derivation we will use {\\scriptsize$\\stackrel{1}{\\approx}$} to indicate where approximate inference is exploited.\n\n/Users/fhuszar/Dropbox/thesis/raw_materials/BALD-GPC/AL_NIPS2011.tex:\n  124  	f \\sim \\mathrm{GP}(\\mu(\\cdot),k(\\cdot,\\cdot)) \\qquad \\y\\vert\\x,f \\sim\\mathrm{Bernoulli}(\\Phi(f(\\x))) \n  125  \\end{align}\n  126: The latent parameter, now called $f$ (previously denoted as $\\param$), is a function $\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$, and is assigned a Gaussian process prior with mean $\\mu(\\cdot)$ and covariance function $k(\\cdot,\\cdot)$. We consider the probit case where given the value of $f$, $y$ takes a Bernoulli distribution with probability $\\Phi(f(\\x))$, and $\\Phi$ is the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution. For further details on GPC see \\cite{rasmussen2005}.\n  127  \n  128: Inference in the GPC model is intractable; given some observations $\\data$, the posterior over $f$ becomes non-Gaussian and complicated. The most commonly used approximate inference methods -- EP,  Laplace approximation, Assumed Density Filtering and sparse methods -- all approximate the posterior by a Gaussian \\cite{rasmussen2005}. Throughout this section we will assume that we are provided with such a Gaussian approximation from one of these methods, though the active learning algorithm does not care which. In our derivation we will use {\\scriptsize$\\stackrel{1}{\\approx}$} to indicate where such an approximation is exploited.\n  129  \n  130  Now, we will compute the informativeness of a query $\\x$ using Eqn.  \\eqref{eqn:rearrangement}.  The entropy of the binary output variable $y$ given a fixed $f$ can be expressed in terms of the binary entropy function $h$: \n  ...\n  181  \\end{align}\n  182  \n  183: In the context of GP models, hyperparameters typically control the smoothness or spatial length-scale of functions. If we maintain a posterior distribution over these hyperparameters, which we can do e.\\,g.\\ via Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, we can choose either to treat them as nuisance parameters $\\theta^-$ and use Eq.\\ \\ref{eqn:BALD_bipartite}, or to include them in $\\theta^+$ and perform active learning over them as well. In certain cases, such as automatic relevance determination\\cite{rasmussen2005}, it may even make sense to treat hyperparameters as variables of primary interest, and the function $f$ itself as nuisance parameter $\\theta^-$.\n  184  \n  185  \\subsection{Preference Learning}\n\n/Users/fhuszar/Dropbox/thesis/raw_materials/lossBayes/lossBayes.tex:\n  246  \\section{SUPERVISED LEARNING} \\label{s:examples}\n  247  \n  248: In this section, we make our framework more concrete by investigating it in the predictive setting presented in \\secref{ss:predictive}. We recall that in order to apply our framework, we need to specify the loss, the action space, the Bayesian observation model and a tractable family $\\mathcal{Q}$ of approximate distributions over the latent variable $\\theta$. In the predictive setting, an action is a prediction function $h:\\mathcal{X}\\rightarrow\\mathcal{Y}$. We let the action space $\\mathcal{H}$ be the set of all possible such functions here -- we are thus in the non-parametric prediction regime where we are free to make arbitrary pointwise decision on $\\mathcal{X}$. This gives us rich predictive possibilities as well as actually enables us to analytically compute $h_q$, as we will see in the next paragraph. For the observation model, we consider Bayesian non-parametric probabilistic models based on Gaussian processes (GPs), which have been successfully applied to model a wide variety of phenomena in the past~\\citep{rasmussen06GP}. %%OPTIONAL\\footnote{Considering the non-parametric setup reduces the issue of model misspecification. Moreover, GPs are often applied using approximate inference and thus provide a useful illustration for our framework.}.\n  249  In \\secref{ss:GPR}, we first look at Gaussian process regression. In this case, we can obtain an analytic form for $p_\\dataset$ and $\\mathcal{R}_{p_\\dataset}(h_q)$ which gives us some insights about the approximation framework as well as when minimizing the KL divergence can be suboptimal. Because the quadratic cost function is not bounded (and so $M = \\infty$), we cannot directly apply our loss-EM algorithm for regression, but we can nevertheless get useful insights which suggest future research directions for regression with sparse GPs. In section~\\ref{ss:GPC}, we consider Gaussian process classification (GPC) which will provide a test bed for the loss-EM algorithm.

We used five different loss matrices: the loss for false negatives was constant at $c_{-}=1$, the loss for false positives $c_{+}$ was varied so that the decision threshold $p_{thresh}=\\frac{c_{+}}{c_{-} + c_{+}}$ changed linearly between 0.5 and 0.05 (rows of \\tableref{tab:results}).\n  385  \n  386: For each dataset, we compared three methods for approximate inference: Laplace approximation, expectation propagation (EP) and loss-EM (run separately for each loss and test set combination).

We let the action space $\\mathcal{H}$ be the set of all possible such functions here -- we are thus in the non-parametric prediction regime where we are free to make arbitrary pointwise decision on $\\mathcal{X}$. This gives us rich predictive possibilities as well as actually enables us to analytically compute $h_q$, as we will see in the next paragraph. For the observation model, we consider Bayesian non-parametric probabilistic models based on Gaussian processes (GPs), which have been successfully applied to model a wide variety of phenomena in the past~\\citep{Rasmussen2006}. %%OPTIONAL\\footnote{Considering the non-parametric setup reduces the issue of model misspecification. Moreover, GPs are often applied using approximate inference and thus provide a useful illustration for our framework.}.\n  249  In \\secref{ss:GPR}, we first look at Gaussian process regression. In this case, we can obtain an analytic form for $p_\\dataset$ and $\\mathcal{R}_{p_\\dataset}(h_q)$ which gives us some insights about the approximation framework as well as when minimizing the KL divergence can be suboptimal. Because the quadratic cost function is not bounded (and so $M = \\infty$), we cannot directly apply our loss-EM algorithm for regression, but we can nevertheless get useful insights which suggest future research directions for regression with sparse GPs. In section~\\ref{ss:GPC}, we consider Gaussian process classification (GPC) which will provide a test bed for the loss-EM algorithm. In both cases, we use a GP as our prior over parameters and let $\\mathcal{Q}$ also be a family of GPs.\n  250  \n  ...\n  384  To investigate the effect of the test distribution $p(x)$ on our method, we generated three different transductive test sets of size 1000, with inputs sampled from $\\mathcal{U}(0,1)$, $\\mathcal{U}(0.2,1.2)$ and $\\mathcal{U}(0.5,1.5)$ respectively (columns of \\tableref{tab:results}), and repeated these experiments 10 times to get significance results. We used five different loss matrices: the loss for false negatives was constant at $c_{-}=1$, the loss for false positives $c_{+}$ was varied so that the decision threshold $p_{thresh}=\\frac{c_{+}}{c_{-} + c_{+}}$ changed linearly between 0.5 and 0.05 (rows of \\tableref{tab:results}).\n  385  \n  386: For each dataset, we compared three methods for approximate inference: Laplace approximation, expectation propagation (EP) and loss-EM (run separately for each loss and test set combination). Both Laplace and EP are standard approaches to GP classification~\\citep{Rasmussen2006}. To evaluate the performance of the methods, we used the following criterion based on the posterior risk:\n  387  \\addtolength{\\abovedisplayskip}{-1mm}\n  388  \\addtolength{\\belowdisplayskip}{-1mm}\n\n23 matches across 6 files\n\n\nSearching 89 files for \"\\!\" (case sensitive)\n\n/Users/fhuszar/Dropbox/thesis/raw_materials/lossBayes/lossBayes.tex:\n   37  \\newcommand{\\dataset}{\\mathcal{D}}\n   38  \\newcommand{\\prob}[1]{\\boldsymbol{\\mathbb{#1}}}\n   39: \\newcommand{\\Var}{\\mathbb{V}\\!\\textnormal{ar}}\n   40  \\newcommand{\\fix}[1]{$^\\text{\\textcolor{red}{?}}$\\marginpar[\\raggedleft\\parbox{2.5cm}{\\raggedleft \\tiny{#1}}]{\\parbox{2.5cm}{\\tiny{#1}}}}\n   41  \\newcommand{\\new}{\\marginpar{NEW}}\n   ..\n  220  \\end{equation*}\n  221  \\begin{equation*}\n  222:     \\textrm{(M-step)} \\quad h^{t+1} = \\argmax{h \\in \\mathcal{H}} \\! \\int_\\Theta q^{t+1}(\\theta) \\, \\log U_M(\\theta,h) d\\theta\n  223  \\end{equation*}\n  224  }}\n  ...\n  406  \\begin{align}\n  407      q^{MED} & = \\argmin{q \\in \\mathcal{Q}} KL(q(\\theta) || p(\\theta)) + C \\sum_i \\xi_i \\\\\n  408:     & \\!\\!\\textrm{s.t.} \\,\\, \\xi_i+p_q(y_i|x_i) \\geq p_q(y|x_i)+\\ell(y_i,y) \\,\\, \\forall i, y \\in \\mathcal{Y},\\notag\n  409  \\end{align}\n  410  % Ferenc wrote: although in practice they use $\\int_\\Theta q(\\theta) \\log p(y|x,\\theta) d\\theta$ rather than $p_q(y|x)$ for computational reasons.

Both methods can be used for approximate inference, and they are examples of loss-calibrated quasi-Monte Carlo introduced in the previous chapter.\n   19  \n   20  Despite the focus on approximate inference, I am going to present the algorithms more generally context of numerical integration. Bayesian quadrature and kernel herding seek a solution to a central problem in statistical machine learning: to compute expectations of functions over probability distributions:\n   ..\n   27  Bayesian quadrature (\\bq{}) estimates integral \\eqref{eqn:integral} by modelling the function $f$ probabilistically, and inferring a posterior distribution conditioned on the observed function values $y_n = f_{x_n}$. Based on the posterior over $f$, the posterior expectation of $Z_{f,p}$ can be used as an estimate to the integral. The points where the function should be evaluated can be found via Bayesian experimental design, providing a deterministic procedure for selecting sample locations. The sequence of points where the function is querried can be interpreted as pseudo-samples in quasi-Monte Carlo.\n   28  \n   29: Herding, proposed recently by \\cite{chen2010super}, produces pseudosamples by minimising the discrepancy of moments between the sample set and the target distribution. Similarly to traditional Monte Carlo, an estimate is formed by taking the empirical mean over samples $\\hat{Z} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^{N}f_{x_n}$. Under certain assumptions, herding has provably fast, $\\mathcal{O}(\\nicefrac{1}{N})$, and has demonstrated strong empirical performance in a variety of tasks. Because herding minimises maximum mean discrepancy from the target distribution $p(x)$, it is a special case of loss-calibrated quasi-Monte Carlo.\n   30  \n   31  In this chapter, I show that the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) criterion used to choose samples in kernel herding is identical to the expected error in the estimate of the integral $Z_{f,p}$ under a Gaussian process prior for $f$. This expected error is the criterion being minimized when choosing samples for Bayesian quadrature. Because Bayesian quadrature assigns different weights to each of the observed function values $f(\\vx)$, we can view Bayesian quadrature as a weighted version of kernel herding. We show that these weights are optimal in a minimax sense over all functions in the Hilbert space defined by our kernel. This implies that Bayesian quadrature is equivalent to a weighted version kernel herding, and as such it also implements loss-calibrated approximate inference.\n   ..\n   76  The formula \\eqref{eqn:herding_criterion} admits an intuitive interpretation: the first term encourages sampling in areas with high mass under the target distribution $p(\\vx)$. The second term discourages sampling at points close to existing samples. \n   77  \n   78: Evaluating \\eqref{eqn:herding_criterion} requires us to compute $\\expect{\\vx' \\sim p}{k(\\vx, \\vx')} $, that is to integrate the kernel against the target distribution. Throughout the paper we will assume that these integrals can be computed in closed form. Whilst the integration can indeed be carried out analytically in several cases \\citep{Song2008,chen2010super}, this requirement is the most pertinent limitation on applications of kernel herding, Bayesian quadrature and related algorithms.\n   79  \n   80  \\subsection{Complexity and convergence Rates}\n   ..\n   82  Criterion \\eqref{eqn:herding_criterion} for selecting the $n+1$-th sample can be evaluated in only $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time. Adding these up for all subsequent samples, and assuming that optimisation in each step has $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ complexity, producing $N$ pseudosamples via kernel herding costs $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ operations in total.\n   83  \n   84: In finite dimensional Hilbert spaces, the herding algorithm has been shown to reduce $\\mmd$ at a rate $\\mathcal{O}(\\nicefrac{1}{N})$, which compares favourably with the $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}})$ rate obtained by non-deterministic Monte Carlo samplers \\citep{chen2010super,Bach2012}. However, as pointed out by \\citep{Bach2012}, this fast convergence is not guaranteed in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, such as the RKHS corresponding to the Gaussian kernel. These results assume that in each step the optimisation in Eqn.\\ \\ref{eqn:herding_criterion} is solved exactly. In addition, herding is shown to converge even if this maximisation is imperfect \\citep{Gelfand2010}.\n   85  \n   86  % ########   #######  \n   ..\n  297  In this section, we examine empirically the rates of convergence of sequential Bayesian quadrature and herding. We examine both the expected error rates, and the empirical error rates.\n  298  \n  299: In all experiments, the target distribution $p$ is chosen a two dimensional mixture of 20 Gaussians, whose equiprobability contours are shown in Figure \\ref{fig:fig1}. To ensure a comparison fair to herding, the target distribution, and the kernel used by both methods, correspond exactly to the one used in \\citep[Fig.\\ 1]{chen2010super}.\n  300  \n  301  For experimental simplicity, each of the sequential sampling algorithms minimizes the next sample location from a pool of 10000 locations randomly drawn from the base distribution. In practice, one would run a gradint-based local optimizer from each of these candidate locations, however in our experiments we found that this did not make a significant difference in the sample locations chosen. \n  ...\n  309  \\end{figure} \n  310  \n  311: We first extend an experiment from \\citep{chen2010super} designed to illustrate the mode-seeking behavior of herding in comparison to random samples. In the first experiment of \\citep{chen2010super}, it is shown that a small number of i.\\,i.\\,d.\\ samples drawn from a multimodal distribution will tend to, by chance, assign too many samples to some modes, and too few to some other modes. In contrast, herding places pseudo-samples (called super-samples in that paper) in such a way as to avoid regions already well-represented, and seeks modes that are under-represented.\n  312  \n  313  We demonstrate that although herding improves upon i.\\,i.\\,d.\\ sampling, the uniform weighting of super-samples leads to sub-optimal performance. Figure \\ref{fig:fig1} shows the first 20 samples chosen by kernel herding, in comparison with the first 8 samples chosen by \\sbq{}. By weighting the 8 \\sbq{} samples by the quadrature weights in \\eqref{eq:bq_weights}, we can obtain the same MMD value as by using the 20 uniformly-weighted herding samples. \n  ...\n  413  		MCMC & $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ & variable & ergodic theorem\\\\\n  414  		i.i.d.

In this case, the respondent is presented a pair of items, and they have to judge which of the two alternatives is more preferable. In cognitive science, this type of preference elicitation is known as two-alternative forced choice, or 2AFC for short \\citep{Fechner1860,Platt1999}. The machine learning community often refers to this kind problem as \\emph{binary preference elicitation}, preference learning or learning to rank \\citep{Chu2005,furnkranz2010}.\n  295  \n  296  Crucially, binary preference elicitation sidesteps most of the problems that eliciting preference on an absolute scale exhibits. Because no absolute scale is used, it does not matter if the scale of ratings used by different respondents are not aligned, as long as there is a mostly monotonic relationship between them. Also, the respondent only needs to be knowledgeable about the two items being compared in order to give an informed response.
